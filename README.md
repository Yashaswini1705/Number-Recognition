# Number-Recognition-with-neural-networks
Handwritten digit recognition system using MNIST dataset
## Description:
Welcome to the Number Recognition project using the MNIST dataset repository! This project focuses on training and deploying neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about deep learning or an experienced practitioner, this project offers a valuable resource for digit recognition.
## Objevtive:
Our primary goal is to build a robust and accurate digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. We aim to create a user-friendly model that can be easily integrated into various applications, such as OCR tools, digitized form processing, and educational platforms.

## Key Features:

1. MNIST Dataset: Utilizes the MNIST dataset, a standard benchmark in digit recognition, comprising 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
2. Model Building: Implements a state-of-the-art machine learning or deep learning model for digit recognition.
3. Data Preprocessing: Demonstrates essential image preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
4. Model Evaluation: Utilizes evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's performance.
5. Deployment: Provides guidance on deploying the trained model in real-world applications.
6. Community and Contribution: Encourages collaboration and contributions from the open-source community to enhance the project.
